# RIDDL

## Description

Riddl is your productive distraction. When you and your friends hit your afternoon slump, stretch your cortex or have a laugh with Riddl.

## Screenshots

*SCREENSHOTS COMING SOON TO A RIDDL NEAR YOU.*

## Background

We set out to have fun building something new. We also were curious about how to create an app that could integrate well on a mobile device.

We decided to work with the Twilio API to create a user experience that everyone could use - text messages. We wanted a simple, fast UX with a minimal front-end.

## Features

* Webhooks with Twilio API
* Validate correct/incorrect user riddle answers
* Heroku Scheduler to deliver riddles during your "afternoon slump."

## Usage

If you can send a text, you can use Riddl. Sign up for Riddl and receive a riddle every afternoon. Simply text "STOP" at any time if you just want to chug coffee in the afternoon instead.

## Development/Contribution

*OPEN FOR BIZZ SOON.*

## Future

* Ensure that user does not receive the same riddle more than once.
* Add more difficult/more hilarious riddles!
